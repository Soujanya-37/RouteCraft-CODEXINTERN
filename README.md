RouteCraft: A Modern React Router & AI Demo
RouteCraft is a polished single-page application (SPA) built with React that demonstrates modern web development best practices. It showcases seamless client-side routing, a reusable and responsive layout, and a unique AI-powered feature using the Gemini API.

‚ú® Features
Client-Side Routing: Utilizes react-router-dom for instant, seamless navigation between pages without full reloads.

Reusable Layout: A central Layout component provides a consistent header and footer across all pages, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.

AI-Powered Content Generation: The contact form integrates with the Google Gemini API to intelligently suggest message content based on a user-provided topic.

Active Link Styling: The navigation bar clearly indicates the user's current location for better UX.

Custom 404 Page: A user-friendly "Not Found" page gracefully handles invalid URLs.
